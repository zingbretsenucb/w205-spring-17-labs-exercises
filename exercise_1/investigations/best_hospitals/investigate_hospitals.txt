What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

In my estimation, these are the 10 hospitals that have the best performance in the dataset.Since all of the hospitals didn't have the same number of ratings I decided not to use the average of the z-scored outcomes. A hospital with one rating could end up with a high ranking by chance. I decided to use the sum of the z-scored ratings instead. Because z-scores are mean-centered around 0, hospitals should end up with summed z-scores around 0 if the scores were assigned by chance. Hospitals that consistently perform better than chance are rewarded with higher ratings.

The hospitals listed above all had measurements for over 40 metrics, and the performed reliably better than average.
