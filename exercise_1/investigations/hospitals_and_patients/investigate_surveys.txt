Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?


Performance X Base  	 Performance X Consistency 	 Stddev X Base         	 Stddev X Consistency
0.1256055590437481  	 0.28449613787296246       	 -0.052500299434543055 	 -0.223225028592188

As it turns out, yes! The performance of the hospitals (the sum of the
z-scores) is correlated with both the base score of the patient surveys as
well as the consistency score of the patient surveys. The variability of the
care does not seem to be related to the base score, but high variability in
performance is negatively correlated with the consistency score!

I used the same approach to calculate the variabilities of the procedures at
each of the hospitals as for the first question. I then used SQL to compute
the correlation between the hospital performance and the two aggregated survey
metrics.
