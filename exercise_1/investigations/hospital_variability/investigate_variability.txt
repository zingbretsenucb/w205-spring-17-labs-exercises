For this analysis, I took the scaled scores (i.e., scaled between 0 and 1, but
not z-scored) to be able to compare the variability across scales. Scaling the
scores in this way puts all the metrics on the same scale, and thus allows for
comparison across scales. Z-scoring allows the performance to be compared
across measures, in terms of "better than average" or "worse than average"
performance, but the variance of the scores can not be compared.
The results for this question rank the measures with the highest standard
deviation across hospitals, and pairs the measure ID with the measure name.

It seems that there is much variability in how hospitals treat patients with
strokes, thromboembolisms and patients who come for fibrinolytic therapy. In
fact, the standard deviations for all of these is over 10%, and up to 22% (for
Thrombolytic Therapy), which is huge variability when looking at hospitals
from all around the country.
